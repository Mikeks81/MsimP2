				<h2>When I Code</h2>
				<p>I'm a recent graduate of The New York Code and Design Academy from their Web Development Intensive program. Quiting my job and taking a leap into web developmnt has been one of the best choices of my life. I spent more hours than i like to admit looking at code and studying. Throughout the course we built both individual and group projects using Sinatra, Rails, JS amongst others. We used Git and GitHub as version control for both individual and group projects. I learned how to communicate effectively with team members to resolve merge conflicts.  I've never enjoyed being in a learning enviornment so much. My favorite part of coding is reaching those "ah-ha" moments. The skills i have gained have set me up for continuously learning throughout the rest of my career. I'm excited to continue learning and contribute to a team.

				<h2>When I'm not Coding</h2>
				<p>
				When I'm not spending time with my wife and daughter put me in a forest on a bike and i'll be happy for hours. I'll often travel far outside of NYC to explore different trails. My favorite trail system is just outside of NYC in Sprain Ridge Park, Yonkers.  I'm pretty adventurous. I've spent time rock climbing, snowboarding and even threw myself out of plane a couple of times. I'm kind of a bro (but not a bro) like that. Photography has also been a passion and profession of mine. I love shooting portrait photography and my heart is in landscape/travel photography. When I do shoot professionally I specialize in event photography such as weddings and coorporate events. I'm always looking to learn and experience new things. I like beer.

			For my final project I made an app that focuses on simplifying a freelancers workflow by automating bookeeping and billing work for them. Users can manage their clients and jobs those clients give them. Users can generate and email invoice PDF's directly from the app. All finances are then viusalized using D3.js chart and YTD figures.  I built FreelanceMe using Ruby on Rails, HTML, Sass, JQuery, D3.js and AJAX. I heavily focused on the UI/UX element of the app by implementing Ajax to create an uninterrupted experience.

				For my final group project we built an app aimed to empower victims of street harassment. Users can anonymously report and map harassment incidents. We built this app with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Jquery, HTML and Sass. We pulled in Google Maps and Places API to find and map locations of harassment defined by the user. We used Github as version control and pair programmed during parts of developement. Lastly we used media queries in order to make it fully mobile ready.
